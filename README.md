### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JQuery
- JQuery Masking Input
- vanilla js

### What I learned

what I learned in making this challenge is:

1. layouting using grid css and flex
2. create dropdown menu on hover
3. create accordion menu with javascript
4. responsive layout mobile [375] and desktop [1440]
5. dimensions of element is affect againt of the wrapper

### Continued development

1. In the future I will make a good css class naming name
2. add animation and transition when hover and activate
3. using react to create this layout.
